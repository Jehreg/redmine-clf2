= Franglish

This plugin is an implementation of a Bilingual (English/French)
style.  It can be used to implement the Government of Canada Common Look and Feel standard, version 2.0. 

There are still many things which need to be edited directly.
Please grep this tree for FRANGLISH and edit to suit.

There is also a variable $IRCanFranchise which can be set to true
to enable a few elements which are only applicable to an IRCan franchise.
